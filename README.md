# Instructions for Setting Up the Project

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, please ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js and npm**: Vite requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed. If you don't have them, you can download and install from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Project Overview

This project is a React-based application scaffolded using Vite. It offers a lightweight, fast, and modern development experience, making it an ideal choice for building scalable web applications. The structure of the project is modular, ensuring maintainability, while the use of Vite provides blazing-fast builds and a snappy developer experience. With its streamlined setup, this project is designed to accelerate your web development workflow.

The application includes a flexible configuration for environment variables, allowing seamless deployment in multiple environments (development, staging, production). Additionally, the project leverages popular libraries and follows best practices to deliver a clean, efficient, and user-friendly codebase.

## Features

- **Fast Development**: Built with Vite, ensuring a quick and smooth development process.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind.
- **Environment Configurations**: Easily switch between different environments using `.env` files.
- **Optimized Build**: Vite's advanced bundling ensures lightweight and performant production builds.
- **Responsive Design**: UI is optimized to work seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.
- **Customizable**: Flexible configuration options allow developers to tailor the application to their needs.

## Step 1: Clone the Project

To begin, you'll need to clone the project repository from our Git repository. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

Now, install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all the required packages specified in the project's package.json file.

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In the root of your project directory, create a new file called `.env`.

Open the `.env` file using a text editor and add the required environment variables according to the `.env-example` file.

## Step 4: Build the Project (Optional)

If the project is pre-built and you don't need to make any changes, you can skip this step. However, if you need to build the project for production, follow these instructions:

```bash
npm run build
```

Vite will start the build process, bundling your application for production. The resulting build output will be available in the `dist` directory.

## Step 5: Start the Development Server

To view the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
